## Iteration 1: [Date: 21/04/23 Time: 11:45]
 - Current iteration is just a computer playing against itself twenty times
 - Each "round" returns a value between -1, 0, 1

## Iteration 2: [Date: 21/04/23 Time: 17:15]
 - On opening the page, via https://yona13.github.io/odin-foundations-rock-paper-scissors/, the user will see a welcome message along with a button, asking the user to play.
 - The welcome message will tell the user to open the console.
 - If the user presses play, they will be asked if they want to enter their name, and if so they will be prompted to enter it
 - If entered, the welcome message will update, and the prompts will be stylised with the player's name
 - The user will then be asked to enter rock, paper or scissors. The case doesn't matter, but spelling is important
 - The user will then play the computer, who will flip a 3-sided coin to select it's option
 - Best of 5. The first person to beat 3 games wins.
 - The player can replay the game, if they so choose.
